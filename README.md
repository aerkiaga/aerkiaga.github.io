Aritz Erkiaga: programmer at heart, medical student by choice. Absolutely not a Web developer though...

Please make yourself at home; I only have [this draft GSoC application](aerkiaga.github.io/docs/gsoc2022.pdf) to offer.

I enjoy using [Avogadro](two.avogadro.cc). So much in fact, that I did spend a
few days contributing to the project. Now, I've come to realize that this year,
Google will allow _everyone_ to participate in Summer of Code... Including
me (presumably)! What an opportunity to spend way more days working on this!

I fully placed my bet on Open Chemistry, I have no interest in any other
organization; so, right after learning they had been accepted again this year,
I've sent a message to their mailing list.

Bonus: I've kept working non-stop since March 1. Avogadro's PDB import is not
50x faster, while hydrogen adjustment is 15x faster. I've also improved
quaternary ammonium handling and formal charge import. I'm not entirely sure
what to do, though. Should I push the changes right away, or wait until the time
to send the code arrives this summer? I'll await further instructions.
