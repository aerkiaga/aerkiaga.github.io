**Aritz Erkiaga**: _programmer at heart, medical student by choice. Absolutely not a Web developer though..._

Please make yourself at home; I only have [this GSoC application](docs/gsoc2022.pdf) to offer.

I enjoy using [Avogadro](https://two.avogadro.cc/). Now, I've come to realize
that this year, Google will allow _everyone_ to participate in Summer of Code...
Including me (presumably)! What an opportunity to spend a summer working on
this!

I fully placed my bet on Open Chemistry, I have no interest in any other
organization; so, right after learning they had been accepted again this year,
I've sent a message to their mailing list.
